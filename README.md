# How to integrate Bolt in your Express.js server

## About

In this post I will show you how to integrate the Bolt for JavaScript framework to your Express.js server to make your Slack application can coexist with your server, this to have both features of both frameworks in a single server.

## What is Bolt?
Bolt is a foundational framework that makes it easier to build Slack apps with the platform's latest features.

Bolt handles much of the foundational setup so you can focus on your app's functionality. Out of the box, Bolt includes:

  - A basic web server to run your app on
  - Authentication and installation handling for all the ins and outs of OAuth
  - Simplified interfaces for all Slack APIs and app features
  - Automatic token validation, retry, and rate-limiting logic
  - Bolt also has built-in type support, so you can get more work done right from your code editor.

Bolt is available for JavaScript, Python and Java.

As I mentioned Bolt for JavaScript is a Node.js framework just like Express.js. So if we want to integrate both frameworks in a single Node.js server is not possible because both create an independent instance of a Node.js server by logic could not coexist on the same server but fortunately Bolt has a feature which allows us to integrate it together with Express.js

## Let's get started

First we will be creating a simple Express.js project and a simple Slack Application.
